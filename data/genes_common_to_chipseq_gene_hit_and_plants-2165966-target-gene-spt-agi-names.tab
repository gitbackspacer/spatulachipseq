1	AT1G02205		Expression of the CER1 gene associated with production of stem epicuticular wax and pollen fertility. Biochemical studies showed that cer1 mutants are blocked in the conversion of stem wax C30 aldehydes to C29 alkanes, and they also lack the secondary alcohols and ketones. These suggested the CER1 protein is an aldehyde decarbonylase, but the exact molecular function of this protein remains to be determined.	Fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily;(source:Araport11)

17	AT1G11310		A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns.

79	AT1G35720	annexin 1	Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins.

120	AT1G57820		Encodes a 645-amino acid methylcytosine-binding protein with a PHD domain, two RING finger domains, and an SRA domain that is involved in centromere heterochromatinization. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro.

348	AT3G30720		QQS is an orphan gene that arose recently in the Arabidopsis thaliana lineage. It was first identified in a screen for genes with altered expression pattern in SS3 mutants which make an abundance of starch. Overexpression of QQS in Arabidopsis increases protein content and decreases total starch content. Thus it appears to function to modulate carbon/nitrogen allocation in Arabidopsis. Over expression of QQS in soybean, rice and maize also results in an increase in protein and decrease in starch levels suggesting that QQS affects similar pathways in a wide range of plants. QQS interacts with NF-YC4 in Arabidopsis and NF-YC4 homologs in rice, soybean and maize. In Arabidopsis QQS is localized the the cytoplasm and when complexed with NF-YC4 , it localizes to the nucleus.
