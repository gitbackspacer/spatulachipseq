The predicted protein bears typical features of transcriptional regulators.  EDM2 contains two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) two zinc-finger-like motifs, a Proline-rich region and a large aspartic acid-rich region.  Both zinc-finger-like stretches resemble the PHD (plant homeodomain) finger motif.  Mutations in EDM2 comprise RPP7 mediated resistance against Hyaloperonospora parasitica isolate Hiks1 (HpHiks1).  EDM2 may function as a direct or indirect regulator of RPP7 expression." "Gene" "ENHANCED DOWNY MILDEW 2;(source:Araport11)"
